# Actual-Database by Joshua Chamberlain
  * The main purpose of Actual-Database is to show how to connect a database and display the database to a WPF application.
  * The program should run in Visual Studio
## Files Needed
  * You need to have access to the Actual Database, which contains the Assets and Employees table.
## Challenges
  * The main challenge was connecting the button to the textbox properly, so that it would display all the data.
## Design Choices
  * I used a button and a textbox for the easy functionality of connecting the two.
  * I used System.Data.OleDb in order to connect to the database.
  * I used a variable called data to add the data into the textbox.
## Future Development
  * In the future, as I learn new techniques, I will think of ways that this program can be more efficent.
